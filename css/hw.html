<h3>Children need to know you are interested in them and want to spend
    time with them</h3>
    <p class="lead">
        Being interested means you spend time playing lego, dressing dolls,
            bowling cricket balls, playing board games, baking a cake, reading
            the school newsletter, listening to a detailed account of how a
            sporting match or dancing class went, learning how the latest bit of
            technology works or listening to their current favourite song –
            you’ll often have fun, learn a lot, and it helps keep you young and
            connected to them.
      </p>
      <h3>Some important things to keep in mind</h3>
      
          <ul>
            <li><span>you</span> are the most significant role model in their
                lives.</li>
                <li>
                    <span>Children</span> need consistency, routines and boundaries.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span>Children</span> are individuals – what works for one child,
                    may not work for the other children.
                  </li>
                  <li><span>Children</span> need limits and choices.</li>
                  <li><span>Children</span> need you to mean what you say.</li>
                  <li>Talk to your <span>Children</span>.</li>
                  <li>Be fair and honest.</li>
          </ul>
