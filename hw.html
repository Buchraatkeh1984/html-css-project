            Introduction
          </h4>
            Bringing up children is the most complex job you'll ever have,
            though it's easier when there is some agreement on how to do it.
            It's never too late to talk about what is important to you both as
            parents and develop some guidelines to help you in the parenting
            years ahead.
          </p>

            Try to avoid arguing or being angry in front of your child or
            letting them play you off against each other. When you disagree,
            explain why and tell them how you’ve compromised.

            Children need to know you are interested in them and want to spend
            time with them
          </h3>
          <p>
            Being interested means you spend time playing lego, dressing dolls,
            bowling cricket balls, playing board games, baking a cake, reading
            the school newsletter, listening to a detailed account of how a
            sporting match or dancing class went, learning how the latest bit of
            technology works or listening to their current favourite song –
            you’ll often have fun, learn a lot, and it helps keep you young and
            connected to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important for you to know who their teacher is, who their
            friends are, their interests and to recognise when they are behaving
            differently. If you know your child well you will see if they are
            upset, worried or unwell and know how to support them.
